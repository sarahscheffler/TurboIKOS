Here we should generate many random Î» with triples. Here we should also be able to verify the beaver triples. And also use fiat-shmamir.py for a source of randomness
Moreover, we will also add the functionalities from sarah's previous comments on which parts belong to which py files. (in this case, from slides, in the circuit.py, we will apply some of the original outlined functionalities of circuit.py into this file)
